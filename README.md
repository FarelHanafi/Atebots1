# FAQ ❓

<details><summary>A1:</summary>

Repl projects are automatically turned off by closing it or inactive in every 5 minutes.  
And UptimeRobot trying to wake it up in every 5 minutes so you can just leave it even if not working for a while.

> #### Q2: How to fix `unsupported/unknown protocol version: ###, update minecraft-data`?
<details><summary>A2:</summary>

This project is using the mineflayer module and **it may not supported on your server version yet.**  
I'm trying to periodically check for updates, so please be patient.
</details>

> #### Q3: How to fix `Invalid move player packet received`?
<details><summary>A3:</summary>

It seems your bot escaped from your bedrock room, so they're in invalid location or moving to that.  
First you have to wipe the bot's playerdata in your server.  
1. Go to the management page of your Aternos server.
2. Click `Files` in the left section.
3. Delete the `world/playerdata/<UUID>.dat` and `<same>.dat_old` file that points the bot username.

**After it, lock the bot immediately as soon as possible!**  
**And change the bot's gamemode to `Creative` to not die.**
</details>

> #### Q4: My bot leaves permanently after n hours.
<details><summary>A4:</summary>

I'm not sure, but Aternos added a feature to their servers that **auto-ban players who playing too long.**  
So just unban them if banned.
